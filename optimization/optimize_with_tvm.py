# If no input path is provided, it defaults to optimizing resnet18.
# Otherwise, it loads models from the specified path and saves them as "optimized".
# The optimization process can be extended to include TVM-specific optimizations.
# The script is designed to be run directly, and it will print the status of the optimization.
# It uses the TVM library to build and optimize models, which can be useful for deployment.
# The output is saved in a specified JSON file, which can be used later in the pipeline.
# This script is part of a larger pipeline for optimizing CNN models for inference.
